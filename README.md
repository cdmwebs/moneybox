Moneybox
========

A web-based personal finance that served two purposes for me:
- Building a first Rails app from the ground up
- Replacing the iOS app Moneywell that I used before I switched to Android.

Functional and usable for finance and budget tracking, but still with a few holes. I'm running it on a free Heroku instance with no problems.

Features
--------
- Envelope budgeting
- Multiple accounts
- Transaction recording (with receipt attachments)
- Transfers to/from accounts and envelopes
- Statement reconciliation

To do
-----
- Mobile is functional, but ugly
- Scheduled transactions
- Filtering in list views
- Drag & drop (for attachments and transfers)
- Autocomplete for payees
- Attachment (receipt) previews
-
